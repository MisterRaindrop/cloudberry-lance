 *
 * lance_scan.c
 *	  Opening a Lance dataset, reading its fragments and turning Arrow batches
 *	  into tuples (DESIGN D4, D7, D12, D16).
 *
 * There is one scan path, not three.  Whether this process is the QD listing
 * fragments for everyone else, a QE reading the share it computed, or a single
 * backend running a 'coordinator' table on its own, the difference is only
 * which fragment ids end up in the state; from there the code is the same.
 * That is deliberate: the debugging modes have to be as trustworthy as the
 * parallel one (I11).
 *
 * Lifetime is the other thing this file is about.  A dataset, a scanner and an
 * Arrow stream all live outside palloc, so they are registered with the runtime
 * handle registry and closed by it on the error path (I6); the Arrow batch and
 * the exported schema are released by a reset callback on this scan's own
 * memory context, which fires on the same paths.
