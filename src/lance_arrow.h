/*
 * Decide the tier of an Arrow field and, for A-tier fields, the PostgreSQL
 * type to declare for it.
 *
 * The decision reads two things (DESIGN D8): the Arrow type, and the field
 * metadata - a field carrying "lance-encoding" = "blob" is B-tier whatever its
 * Arrow type says.  That is a policy choice rather than a technical limit:
 * such a field is Lance's v1 blob encoding and its bytes do arrive with the
 * scan, measured at 1, 2 and 4 MiB.  Lance's v2 blob encoding is refused by a
 * rule of its own, ahead of the struct rule, because a v2 descriptor is a
 * struct of A-tier scalars and would otherwise be readable (DESIGN D-A4).
 *
 * A struct is A-tier when every one of its subfields is, and it becomes a
 * PostgreSQL composite type that IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA creates; *typid is
 * RECORDOID here, because the composite type's name is derived from the
 * foreign table and so does not exist yet.  A map<utf8|large_utf8, A-tier
 * scalar> is A-tier and becomes jsonb.
 *
 * Returns true when the field is A-tier, in which case *typid and *typmod are
 * set; *is_b_tier is always set and is the inverse of the return value.
 * Raises an error only if the Arrow schema itself cannot be parsed.
