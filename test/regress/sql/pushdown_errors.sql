-- pushdown_errors: what happens when a qualifier names a column Lance cannot
-- give.  The column a pushed qualifier reads is not projected, so without the
-- check DESIGN D4 adds it would meet no validation at all - and the refusals
-- this package rests on ("B-tier is loud, never silent") would have a side
-- door (AC7, Must NOT 7).
