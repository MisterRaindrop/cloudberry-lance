 * Include this instead of <lance/lance.h> or <nanoarrow/nanoarrow.h>: both
 * declare the Arrow C data interface structs, but only nanoarrow.h defines the
 * ARROW_FLAG_* macros and it guards that whole block on
 * ARROW_FLAG_DICTIONARY_ORDERED.  Pulling in lance.h first would therefore
 * leave the flags undefined and make nanoarrow.h declare ArrowArrayStream a
 * second time, so the order below is not cosmetic.
