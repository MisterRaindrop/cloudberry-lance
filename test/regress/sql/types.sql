-- types: every A-tier type read through the wrapper, value by value against
-- what pylance read out of the same fixtures (test/fixtures/expected/
-- types_all.jsonl, large_text.jsonl and blob.jsonl).
--
-- The table is imported rather than written by hand, so the column types are
-- the ones IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA generates and the two halves of the type
-- bridge - what it declares and what it reads - are checked against each other.
--
-- pg_regress runs psql with PGDATESTYLE=Postgres,MDY and PGTZ=PST8PDT, while
-- the reference values are ISO and UTC.  UTC is also what an Arrow timestamp
-- means, zone name or not, so the suite sets both rather than depending on the
-- harness.  Text columns go through to_json() because two fixture values carry
-- a tab and a newline; binary columns print as bytea's hex.
