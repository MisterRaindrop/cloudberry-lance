-- import: IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA against the P0 fixtures, over file:// and
-- s3://.  The fixture directory and the bucket differ per environment, so the
-- servers are built from the regress.* settings the gate injects and no path
-- or credential is ever printed.
--
-- The dataset directories are named <name>.lance, so that is what LIMIT TO
-- names and what the imported table is called; they are renamed afterwards to
-- keep the rest of the suite readable.
