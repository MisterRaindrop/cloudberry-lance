 * thread inherits the signal mask of the thread that creates it.  So every
 * call into lance-c, not just the first, is made with all signals blocked on
 * the backend's main thread; the mask is restored as soon as the call returns
 * and anything that arrived meanwhile is delivered right there, still on the
 * main thread.  See lance_rt_block_signals() for the longer story.
 *
 * `stmt` must be the FFI call and at most an assignment of its result: nothing
 * inside may ereport() or otherwise longjmp, because that would skip the
 * restore and leave the backend deaf to every signal for good.  Call
 * lance_rt_session(), palloc() and LANCE_CHECK() before or after, never inside.
