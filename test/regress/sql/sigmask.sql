-- sigmask: the observable half of I5.
--
-- lance-c builds its thread pools lazily - tokio's runtime on the first
-- block_on(), lance's own IO and compute pools on the first read - and a new
-- thread inherits the signal mask of the thread that created it.  The wrapper
-- therefore makes every call into lance-c with all signals blocked on the
-- backend's main thread, so that no Rust thread can ever take SIGINT, SIGUSR1,
-- SIGALRM or SIGTERM and run a PostgreSQL signal handler.  This suite reads the
-- masks back out of /proc after a scan that ran in this very backend
-- (mpp_execute 'coordinator'), and also checks that the main thread got its
-- own mask back afterwards.
--
-- Thread counts follow the core count, so only the verdicts are printed.
