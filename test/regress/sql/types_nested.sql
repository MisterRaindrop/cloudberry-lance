-- types_nested: the readable half of struct and map (AC1, AC2).

-- The tables are imported rather than written by hand, because the composite
-- type a struct column needs does not exist until IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA makes
-- one: the two halves of the bridge - the type it declares and the value it
-- reads - are checked against each other, as in the types suite.
--
-- The values are test/fixtures/expected/nested.jsonl and maps.jsonl, which is
-- what pylance reads out of the same datasets.  Two of those values are UTF-8
-- (a string subfield and a map key), and everything committed here is ASCII,
-- so those two are checked as hex and by lookup instead of being printed.
--
-- Text subfields go through to_json() because two fixture values carry a tab
-- and a newline, which unaligned output would otherwise spread over three lines.
