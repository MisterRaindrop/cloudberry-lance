-- vector: the three distance operators on real[], and ORDER BY distance LIMIT k
-- sent to Lance's nearest-neighbour search (vector Top-K DESIGN).
--
-- vectors.lance has no index, so Lance searches it exhaustively and every
-- pushed-down result must equal the exact one; vectors_idx.lance holds the same
-- rows with an IVF_PQ index, whose results are approximate and are only ever
-- checked by bounds.  Which segment searches depends on the session id, so it
-- is compared against that, never printed.  vectors_seg.lance has the same rows
-- again, indexed the distributed way: one segment for each of fragments 0-2 and
-- none for fragment 3, which is what a search split by fragment has to handle.
